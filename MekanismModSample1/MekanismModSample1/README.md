# About #

Mekanism is a Minecraft add-on featuring special machinery that can be used to create powerful tools, armor, and weapons.  It also includes a gas network that can be implemented by other mods.

# Modpacks, websites, reviews, or anything else #

Some people really don't like others to review or distribute their mods, something which I honestly don't understand.  You are the ones who help get this mod into the Minecraft community's hands, which seems like a good thing from my perspective.
So go ahead, do whatever you like.  I honestly just don't want you messaging me on IRC or on the forums, asking my permission.  If you need proof, provide a link to this page, or give them information on the MIT license.

# License #

Licenses are not really my friend -- strict closed source software really drives me nuts.  Even more, with a derivative work coded in a language such as Java, nothing can really prevent people from looking through my source with JD-GUI.
However, I welcome people wanting to learn how to mod, and because of this, I have licensed Mekanism under the MIT License, which doesn't include many guidelines.  This basically means you have the right to use my mod's source code, learn
from it, and even use it in your own mod.  You even have the right to distribute this mod to the public and make money off of it, although this is something I wouldn't necessarily encourage! :)
